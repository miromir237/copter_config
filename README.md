Betaflight/Butterflight config files for my copters

## M220
MartianII 220 - 5" Alien style copter. Originaly running with Matek F405-AIO, Racerstart Tatoo 35Amp ESCs and T-Motor F40 III motors. Currently rebuild to run on KISS electronics.

## M250v2
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Build with DYS Storm motors listening to Spedix30a BLHeli32 ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo. Sold to fellow fpv pilot.

## M250v4
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Currently running BrotherHobby R5 2400kv motors  on DYS Aria ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo.

The best flying experience is with 5.5" propellers. I especialy like Gemfan 5552 but they are killing my betteries. I am currently running Dalprop T5544C which seem to be a sweetspot for efficiency and good flying experience.

## Spectre
Rotorama Spectre is 6" capable freestyle copter designed by Czech drone racing team. It is similar style as Armattan Chameleon/Rooster. It is lighter than MartianII frame and I like flying it but I am strugling to filter out jello from HD recordings. Currently it is waiting for me to decide what to do with it.
After some time of collecting dust I rebuild it with KISS electronics from my other build. It is now running full KISS (v2 and 25A 4in1) with Emax LS2207 1900kv motors power combo and on 5s it's a blast. It is very nice proximity flyer on 4s.

## AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v1
As I had some spares laying around I felt sorry for this frame and bought replacement for my BHR3 burnt motor so I could rebuild it. I was pleasantly surprised by the result.
With Matek F405 AIO, Racerstar Tatto 35A ESC it flies almost perfectly. It is on latest BFL 3.5.4 with 8k/2k loops and DSHOT1200.

## AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2
Initialy planned as longrange copter but the frame body is very small, berely to fit basic electronics. I was very much strugling with jello on v1 version of the frame. AmaxInno released v2 recently with 6mm arms and I immediately went for it. Swapped the frame and jello is gone, almost.
It is now running HeliRC Sping FC, Racerstart PG50 4in1 ESC, iFlight Tachyon 2207 1750kv motors and I am currently in test/tunning phase. So far it looks promissing but I will probably switch from Butter to Betaflight.

## AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 number 2
I was very much pleased with AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 so I bought one more. I am runnig it with Racerstar 35A BLHeli_S esc, RadixFC and iFlight Tachyon 2207 1750kv motors.
I am currently in test/tunning phase.


## Eclair 3"
Build for my son. Running Superman 4850kv motors, HGLRC F4 Mini and HGLRC F330 ESC. R-XSR, HGLRC mini VTX and Runcam DVR module. It is very mellow flier on 3s.

## IntrepidV2
AirbladeAUV IntrepidV2 Pro 3" built as portable cinematic quad. Runcam Split Mini V2 inside taking some nice FullHD video. Nope, it cam with wierd lenses that leave edges of the image blured even after re-focusing. FPV feed is super noisy and I will have to put some LC filter between the cam and power leads. REally frustrating.
Quad it self flies really nice. Not much jello, only on hard throttle. I have to lear fly it though. It's quite a bit different than my bigger birds.

## Dingo 6"
Basically got caught in Xmas discounts and bough bunch of KISS ESCs, this frame and newly realease ClearTXv2. Supplied it with KISSv2 FC, motors, LEDs, Foxeer Falkor, etc. and now it flies 6s no problem.
Really low noise profile. The frame seems to be really stiff. Overall very pleased.
