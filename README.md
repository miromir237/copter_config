Betaflight/Butterflight config files for my copters

## M220
MartianII 220 - 5" Alien style copter. Originaly running with Matek F405-AIO, Racerstart Tatoo 35Amp ESCs and T-Motor F40 III motors. Currently rebuild to run on KISS electronics.

## M250v2
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Build with DYS Storm motors listening to Spedix30a BLHeli32 ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo. Sold to fellow fpv pilot.

## M250v4
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Currently running BrotherHobby R5 2400kv motors  on DYS Aria ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo.

The best flying experience is with 5.5" propellers. I especialy like Gemfan 5552 but they are killing my betteries. I am currently running Dalprop T5544C which seem to be a sweetspot for efficiency and good flzing experience.

## Spectre
Rotorama Spectre is 6" capable freestyle copter designed by Czech drone racing team. It is similar style as Armattan Chameleon/Rooster. It is lighter than MartianII frame and I like flying it but I am strugling to filter out jello from HD recordings. Currently it is waiting for me to decide what to do with it.

## AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2
Initialy planned as longrange copter but the frame body is very small, berely to fit basic electronics. I was very much strugling with jello on v1 version of the frame. AmaxInno released v2 recently with 6mm arms and I immediately went for it. Swapped the frame and jello is gone, almost.
It is running full KISS (v2 and 25A 4in1) power combo, iFlight Tachyon 2207 1750kv motors, TBS UnifyHV, R9M Slim, Foxeer Predator Mini v2. I am really enjoying it with 6" props and 5s battery but I had some glitches recently so I am planning to switch to HobbyWing 45A esc with RadixFC. The KISS will go to my Spectre frame.

## AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 number 2
I was very much pleased with AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 so I bought one more. Putting Racerstart PG50 4in1 ESC with RevoltV2, Matek VTX-HV and Foxeer Falkor camera. This is a real power house with Emax LS2207 1900kv motors on 5s. It has zero jello on 6" and bit of jello on 7".
In pursuit of 7" without jello I have put HeliRC Sping FC into it. Haven't had a chance to test it, yet.

## Eclair 3"
Build for my son. Running Superman 4850kv motors, HGLRC F4 Mini and HGLRC F330 ESC. R-XSR, HGLRC mini VTX and Runcam DVR module. It is very mellow flier on 3s.
