Betaflight/Butterflight config files for my copters

## M220
MartianII 220 - 5" Alien style copter. Originaly running with Matek F405-AIO, Racerstart Tatoo 35Amp ESCs and T-Motor F40 III motors. Currently rebuild to run on KISS electronics.

## M250v2
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Build with DYS Storm motors listening to Spedix30a BLHeli32 ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo. Sold to fellow fpv pilot.

## M250v4
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Currently running Emax LS2207 1900kv motors on DYS Aria ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo.

## Spectre
Rotorama Spectre is 6" capable freestyle copter designed by Czech drone racing team. It is similar style as Armattan Chameleon/Rooster. It is lighter than MartianII frame and I like flying it but I am strugling to filter out jello from HD recordings. 

It is currently running BrotherHobby R5 2400kv motors and Racerstar Tattoo 35A ESCs (from M220 copter) and Matek F405-AIO flight controler. 

The best flying experience is with 5.5" propellers. I especialy like Gemfan 5552 but they are killing my betteries. I am currently running Dalprop T5544C which seem to be a sweetspot for efficiency and good flzing experience.
