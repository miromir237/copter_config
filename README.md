# copter_config
Betaflight/Butterflight config files for my copters

## M250v2
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Currently running BH R5 2400kv motors on DYS Aria ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX F405-STD combo.

The best flying experience is with 5.5" propellers. I especialy like Gemfan 5552 but they are killing my betteries. I am currently running Dalprop T5544C which seem to be a sweetspot for efficiency and good flzing experience.

## Spectre
Rotorama Spectre is 6" capable freestyle copter designed by Czech drone racing team. It is similar style as Armattan Chameleon/Rooster. It is lighter than MartianII frame and I like flying it but I am strugling to filter out jello from HD recordings.
