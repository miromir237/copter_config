Betaflight/Butterflight config files for my copters

## M220
MartianII 220 - 5" Alien style copter. Originaly running with Matek F405-AIO, Racerstart Tatoo 35Amp ESCs and T-Motor F40 III motors. Currently rebuild to run on KISS electronics.

## M250v2
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Build with DYS Storm motors listening to Spedix30a BLHeli32 ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo. Sold to fellow fpv pilot.

## M250v4
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Currently running BH R5 2400kv motors on DYS Aria ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo.

The best flying experience is with 5.5" propellers. I especialy like Gemfan 5552 but they are killing my betteries. I am currently running Dalprop T5544C which seem to be a sweetspot for efficiency and good flzing experience.

## Spectre
Rotorama Spectre is 6" capable freestyle copter designed by Czech drone racing team. It is similar style as Armattan Chameleon/Rooster. It is lighter than MartianII frame and I like flying it but I am strugling to filter out jello from HD recordings. 

It is currently running BrotherHobby R3 1660kv motors and Racerstar Tattoo 35A ESCs (from M220 copter) and DYS F4v2 Pro flight controler. It was running Matek F405-AIO but I wanted to test if I get rid of jello by replacing FC. That did not worked out.
