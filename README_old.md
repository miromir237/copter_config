Betaflight/Butterflight config files for my copters

## M220 - Sold
MartianII 220 - 5" Alien style copter. Originaly running with Matek F405-AIO, Racerstart Tatoo 35Amp ESCs and T-Motor F40 III motors. Currently rebuild to run on KISS electronics.

## M250v2 - Sold
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Build with DYS Storm motors listening to Spedix30a BLHeli32 ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo. Sold to fellow fpv pilot.

## M250v4 - Decommisioned and frame sold
MartianII 250 - 6" Alien style copter. Currently running BrotherHobby R5 2400kv motors  on DYS Aria ESCs and Matek FCHUB-VTX + F405-STD combo.

The best flying experience is with 5.5" propellers. I especialy like Gemfan 5552 but they are killing my betteries. I am currently running Dalprop T5544C which seem to be a sweetspot for efficiency and good flying experience.

Decommisioned due motor failure on Dingo6. Motors moved to Dingo, electronic moved to AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 number 2.

## Spectre
Rotorama Spectre is 6" capable freestyle copter designed by Czech drone racing team. It is similar style as Armattan Chameleon/Rooster. It is lighter than MartianII frame and I like flying it but I am strugling to filter out jello from HD recordings. Currently it is waiting for me to decide what to do with it.
After some time of collecting dust I rebuild it with KISS electronics from my other build. It is now running full KISS (v2 and 25A 4in1) with Emax LS2207 1900kv motors power combo and on 5s it's a blast. It is very nice proximity flyer on 4s.

## AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v1 - Decommisioned
As I had some spares laying around I felt sorry for this frame and bought replacement for my BHR3 burnt motor so I could rebuild it. I was pleasantly surprised by the result.
With Matek F405 AIO, Racerstar Tatto 35A ESC it flies almost perfectly. It is on latest BFL 3.5.4 with 8k/2k loops and DSHOT1200.

Decommisioned after crash where I broke one arm. Kept for spares. BHR3 were moved to new frame (Flosstyle 6") I bought.

## AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 - currently on shelf
Initialy planned as longrange copter but the frame body is very small, berely to fit basic electronics. I was very much strugling with jello on v1 version of the frame. AmaxInno released v2 recently with 6mm arms and I immediately went for it. Swapped the frame and jello is gone, almost.
It is now running HeliRC Sping FC, Racerstart PG50 4in1 ESC, iFlight Tachyon 2207 1750kv motors and I am currently in test/tunning phase. So far it looks promissing but I will probably switch from Butter to Betaflight.
I have replaced electronics with Matek F405-AIO and Racerstar Tatto 35A ESC from AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v1 that was decommisioned.

## AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 number 2 - Decommisioned and frame sold
I was very much pleased with AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 so I bought one more. I am runnig it with Racerstar 35A BLHeli_S esc, RadixFC and iFlight Tachyon 2207 1750kv motors.
Electronics moved to MBEpic Cinematic7 and replaced with Matek-F405-STD from M250v4. Flies but will need some more tunning on BTFL40.
Decided to decrease my fleet a bit. Frame sold to fellow pilot. Electronics kept fo spares.

## Eclair 3"
Build for my son. Running Superman 4850kv motors, HGLRC F4 Mini and HGLRC F330 ESC. R-XSR, HGLRC mini VTX and Runcam DVR module. It is very mellow flier on 3s.

## IntrepidV2 transfered to IH3 frame - Sold
AirbladeAUV IntrepidV2 Pro 3" built as portable cinematic quad. Runcam Split Mini V2 inside taking some nice FullHD video. Nope, it cam with wierd lenses that leave edges of the image blured even after re-focusing. FPV feed is super noisy and I will have to put some LC filter between the cam and power leads. REally frustrating.
Quad it self flies really nice. Not much jello, only on hard throttle. I have to lear fly it though. It's quite a bit different than my bigger birds.

## Dingo 6" - ready to be sold
Basically got caught in Xmas discounts and bough bunch of KISS ESCs, this frame and newly realease ClearTXv2. Supplied it with KISSv2 FC, motors, LEDs, Foxeer Falkor, etc. and now it flies 6s no problem.
Really low noise profile. The frame seems to be really stiff. Overall very pleased.
Motors replaced 23.4.2019 with BHR5 2400kv after I bent shaft on one of the Tachyons (I have let a fellow runner try to fly it - never again).
Took the KISS stuf and put it into MB Epic on which I blew up one ESC and I am not willing to buy more stuff right now.
It is rocking BrainFPV Radix FC + HobbyWing 45A 4in1 combo, Foxeer Falkor, Matek VTX-HV and R9MM.

## MB Epic Cinematic7 - Sold
I was deciding for too long but at last when a colleague was on bussiness travel to US I went for it and ordered it also with MBPrimos 2150kv.
Used the DYS Aria 32bit ESCs from M250v4 and other electronics from AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v2 number 2 (BrainFPV RadixFC and PDB + Matek-VTX HV + R9 Slim as reciver).
I replaced caps on ESCs with 220uF 50V althoug that was not neccesary. There is plenty room for VTX and receiver and RAdix with it's PDB fitted well. Pretty happy how it came out.
Stuffed with KISS electronics from Dingo6". Giving a shot to KISS on 7".

## Flosssyle 6" - disassembled and frame on shelf
Build from spare parts I had after AmaxInno Freestyle 7" v1 crash. It's running BHR3 1660kv, BrainFPV Radix FC, HobbyWing 45A 4in1, Runcam Swift, Matek VTX-HV and Gemfan 6042x3. The kv is really low and it needs at least 5s to fly as I wish. 6s seems to be best for it. It'll need bit more tunning. It's kind of wobbly and the feel is not as good as on Dingo6. Frame it self is fine, well designed and thought. If you use recommended parts you're ok.
It seems that gyro on Helio Spring died after a crash. 1s replaced ESC (Racerstart PG50), twitches still there. Replaced FC with Radix, twitches gone for now.
