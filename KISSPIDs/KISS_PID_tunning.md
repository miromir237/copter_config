# KISS PID tunning

KISS is using classic PID controll. You can watch some old youtube videos about quad PID tuning and it will work for the most part.
I have found a video with some generic guidelines for KISS.

- The "half - 30%" rule: D = (10*P) / 2 - 30%
- P is 15-20% higher on Pitch axis usually as there is more momentum to carry. Depends on the quad frame (usually applies to bus style with top mounted battery).
